# Habreak

## Getting Started

1. Download and install [expo](https://expo.io/learn) with `npm install expo-cli --global`
2. Run `npm install` to download the node packages
3. Run `npm run ios` (Mac only) or `npm run android`. This should open up a localhost webpage, and then later a phone simulator.
	1. you can also just run `expo start` and then select "Run on iOS Simulator"/"Run on Android Simulator" from the menu on the lefthand side of the webpage that opens.
	2. This could take a bit tho
	3. If for whatever reason you need to close your simulator; you might need to quit out of the application instead of just closing the window
4. From the device's home/app screen, select "Expo" and close out of the welcome screen by clicking the X on the top right corner.
